# Project Based Learning Rust

This project follows the philosophy of Project-Based Learning. It is centered around projects to assist everyone in learning Rust.

### What is Project-Based Learning?

Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an inquiry-based and student-centered teaching method that immerses students in real-world projects, fostering deep learning and thinking skills.

Compared to teacher-led instruction, PBL encourages student participation, collaboration, and problem-solving, turning students into active participants in their own learning.

### Project-Based Learning in Rust

I will explore using the method of project-based learning to ease the learning curve of Rust. Leveraging the abundance of current open-source Rust projects, I will specially select various projects suitable for beginners to progressively learn, covering the main application areas of Rust.
